# XAML code editor

The XAML code editor in the [Visual Studio IDE](../../get-started/visual-studio-ide.md) is the creative launching pad that you can use to create WPF, UWP, and Xamarin apps for the Windows platform. The XAML code editor supports the [XAML Hot Reload]() feature, which allows you to edit your app's code and UI on-the-fly in real-time while you  during debugging, debug your app on-the-fly in real-time, supports modern intelligence by way of IntelliCode, 

Here is a screenshot of the XAML code editor experience
