# XAML code editor

The XAML code editor in the [Visual Studio IDE](../../get-started/visual-studio-ide.md) includes all the tools you need to create WPF and UWP apps for the Windows platform. This article focuses on what makes the code editor unique to developing with XAML. 

To start, let's take a look at the IDE with an open WPF project. The following image shows several of the key integrated development environment (IDE) tools you'll use along with the XAML code editor. From the bottom left of the image going clockwise, they are:

- The **[XAML code editor](#xaml-code-editor-window)** window&mdash;the subject of this article&mdash;where you create and edit your code. 
- The **[XAML Designer](creating-a-ui-by-using-xaml-designer-in-visual-studio.md)** window, where you design your UI.
- The **[Toolbox](../../ide/reference/toolbox.md)** dockable window, where you add controls to your UI.
- The **[Debug](../../debugger/debugger-feature-tour.md)** button, where you run your code and debug it. (You can also edit your code in real-time while you're debugging with [XAML Hot Reload](xaml-tools/xaml-hot-reload.md).)
- The **[Solution Explorer](../../ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio.md)** window, where you manage your files, projects, and solutions. 
- The **[Properties](../../ide/reference/properties-window.md)** window, where you change the way your UI looks.

To continue, let's dig in to the details about the XAML code editor. 

## XAML code editor window

The code editor window for XAML apps has many of the features you find in our standard IDE, and also a few unique features that make developing XAML apps easier.

Here's a look at the code window itself.

Next, let's take a look at the functions of each of the UI elements in the code editor. 

### Top left, first row

Starting at the top, there's a Design tab, a Swap Panes button, and a XAML tab. 

If you choose the **Design** tab, your focus changes to the XAML Designer window. To change the focus back to the XAML code editor, choose the **XAML** tab. And, if you want to swap the locations of both the XAML Design and the XAML code editor windows within the IDE, choose the **Swap Panes** button.

### Top right, first row

To the right of the top row in the code editor, there's a series of three buttons. 

(example pop-up button, unique to XAML code editor)

| Icon | Location | Name | Function | Appears in... |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| ![XAML code editor - name of feature](media/name-of-file.png) | Code editor | Tooltip description | (Add detailed description) | Code editor |
| ![XAML code editor - name of feature](media/name-of-file.png) | Code editor | Tooltip description | (Add detailed description) | Code editor |
| ![XAML code editor - name of feature](media/name-of-file.png) | Code editor | Tooltip description | (Add detailed description) | Code editor |
