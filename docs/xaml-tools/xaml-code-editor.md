# XAML code editor

The XAML code editor in the [Visual Studio IDE](../../get-started/visual-studio-ide.md) includes all the tools you need to create WPF and UWP apps for the Windows platform. The XAML code editor supports modern intelligence by using [IntelliCode](/visualstudio/intellicode/). It also supports the [XAML Hot Reload](xaml-tools/xaml-hot-reload.md) feature, which allows you to edit your app's code and UI on-the-fly in real-time while debugging.

Here's a screenshot of the XAML code editor experience.

Let's explore the many parts that comprise the XAML code editor, starting with the code editor window.

## XAML code editor window

The code editor window for XAML apps has many of the features you find in our standard IDE, and also a few unique features that make developing XAML apps easier.

First, in the following screenshot, let's take a look at the code window itself.
