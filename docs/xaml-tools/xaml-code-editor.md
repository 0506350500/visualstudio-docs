# XAML code editor

The XAML code editor in the [Visual Studio IDE](../../get-started/visual-studio-ide.md) includes all the tools you need to create WPF and UWP apps for the Windows platform. The XAML code editor supports modern intelligence by way of IntelliCode. It also supports the [XAML Hot Reload](xaml-tools/xaml-hot-reload.md) feature, which allows you to edit your app's code and UI on-the-fly in real-time while debugging.

Here is a screenshot of the XAML code editor experience. (We'll break this down for you further; read on.)

## XAML code editor window

The code editor window for XAML apps has many of the features you find in our standard IDE, and also a few unique features that make developing XAML apps easier.

First, in the following screenshot, let's take a look at the code window itself.
