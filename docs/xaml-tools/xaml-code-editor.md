# XAML code editor

The XAML code editor in the [Visual Studio IDE](../get-started/visual-studio-ide.md) includes all the tools you need to create WPF and UWP apps for the Windows platform. This article outlines the role the code editor plays when you develop XAML-based apps, and on the features that are unique to the XAML code editor in Visual Studio 2019. 

To start, let's take a look at the IDE (integrated development environment) with an open WPF project. The following image shows several of the key IDE tools you'll use along with the XAML code editor. From the bottom left of the image going clockwise, they are:

- The **[XAML code editor](#xaml-code-editor-ui)** window&mdash;the subject of this article&mdash;where you create and edit your code. 
- The **[XAML Designer](creating-a-ui-by-using-xaml-designer-in-visual-studio.md)** window, where you design your UI.
- The **[Toolbox](../ide/reference/toolbox.md)** dockable window, where you add controls to your UI.
- The **[Debug](../debugger/debugger-feature-tour.md)** button, where you run your code and debug it. <br>(You can also edit your code in real-time while you're debugging with [XAML Hot Reload](xaml-hot-reload.md).)
- The **[Solution Explorer](../ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio.md)** window, where you manage your files, projects, and solutions. 
- The **[Properties](../ide/reference/properties-window.md)** window, where you change the way your UI looks.

To continue, let's learn more about the XAML code editor. 

## XAML code editor UI

The code editor window for XAML apps shares some UI (user interface) elements that also appear in our standard IDE, it also includes a few unique features that make developing XAML apps easier.

Here's a look at the XAML code editor window itself.

Next, let's take a look at the functions of each of the UI elements in the code editor.

### Top left, first row

Starting at the top left, and from left to right, there's a **Design** tab, a **Swap Panes** button, a **XAML** tab, and a **Pop-Out XAML** button.

![Screenshot of the first of the two top rows of the XAML code editor window in Visual Studio 2019, in which UI elements on the left are highlighted](media/xaml-code-editor-top-row-left.png)

Here's how they work: 

- The **Design** tab changes the focus from the XAML code editor to the XAML Designer.
- The **Swap Panes** button reverses the location of the XAML Designer and the XAML code editor in the IDE.
- The **XAML** tab changes the focus back to the XAML code editor.
- The **Pop Out XAML** button creates a separate XAML code editor window that's outside of the IDE.

### Top right, first row

Continuing at the top right, and from left to right, there's a **Vertical Split** button, a **Horizontal Split** button, and a **Collapse Panes** button.

![Screenshot of the first of the two top rows of the XAML code editor window in Visual Studio 2019, in which UI elements on the right are highlighted](media/xaml-code-editor-top-row-right.png)

Here's how they work:

- The **Vertical Split** button changes the location of the XAML Designer and the XAML code editor in the IDE from a horizontal alignment to a vertical alignment.
- The **Horizontal Split** button changes the location of the XAML Designer and the XAML code editor in the IDE from a vertical alignment to a horizontal alignment.
- The **Collapse Pane** button hides the XAML code editor temporarily while you focus on using the XAML Designer within the IDE. (To restore the XAML code editor, choose the same button again, which is now named the **Expand Pane** button.)

> [!TIP]
> You can run two parallel instances of the XAML code editor concurrently by using both the **Pop Out XAML** button and the **Expand Pane** button.
>
> You might find it useful to have one larger window open that reveals more of your code in context and a smaller pane open that has its focus directly on the code that you're working on.

### Top left, second row

In the second row of the top left, there are two Window dropdown lists. However, if you view the Tooltip for these UI elements, it further identifies them as the "Element: Window" and the "Member: Window".

![Screenshot of the second of the two top rows of the XAML code editor window in Visual Studio 2019, in which both Window dropdown lists are visible](media/xaml-code-editor-top-row-windows.png)

The Window dropdown lists have different functions, as follows:

- The **Element: Window** on the left helps you view and navigate to sibling or parent elements. 

  Specifically, it shows you an outline-like view that reveals the tag structure of your code. When you select from the list, your focus in the code editor will snap to the line of code that includes the element you selected.

    ![Screenshot of the Element: Window dropdown list in Visual Studio 2019](media/xaml-element-window-dropdown.png)

- The **Member: Window** on the right helps you view and navigate to attribute or child elements.

    Specifically, it shows you a list of the properties in your code. When you select from the list, your focus in the code editor will snap to the line of code that includes the property you selected.

### Middle pane + right-side scroll indicators

The middle pane is the "code" part of the XAML code editor. It includes most of the features that you'll find in the [IDE code editor](../get-started/tutorial-editor.md), along with a few unique-to-XAML features that we'll describe in more detail. 

In the code editor, 

- Button to drag out two parallel code editors
- Unused Usings, lightbulb for removing

#### Color indicators

The code editor highlights the changes you make to your code, while you're making them.

When you make a change to your code, the 

Right-click menu

- Quick Actions
- Only expands a lightbulb if its available
- Rename (namespaces only)
- Peek Definition
- Go To Definition
- Snippet Features
- Surround With
- Insert Snippet
- Outline

Highlight unique things

- XAML support for snippets
- XAML #regions
- XAML Comments
- Lightbulbs
    - All Platforms - Adding missing namespace
    - UWP â€“ Add conditional XAML
- XAML Rename namespace using F2
- Structure Analyzers (dotted lines between the tags vertically)
- Only between tags and not container properties
- Settings

## XAML code editor optional settings

You can use the [Options](../ide/reference/options-dialog-box-visual-studio.md) dialog box to change the default settings for the XAML code editor. To view the settings, choose **Tools** > **Options** > **Text Editor** > **XAML**. 

![Screenshot of the Options list for the XAML text editor](media/xaml-tools-options.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Here's how to use keyboard shortcuts to access the Options dialog box: 
>
> Press **Ctrl**+**Q** to search the IDE, type **Options**, and then press **Enter**. Next, press **Ctrl**+**E** to search the Options dialog box, type **Text Editor** and press **Enter**, and then type **XAML** and press **Enter**.
>  
> For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see the [Shortcut tips for Visual Studio](../ide/productivity-shortcuts.md#code-editor) page.

### XAML-specific tools

Here are the settings in the Options dialog that can enhance your editing experience when you develop XAML apps.

- Formatting Options (XAML specific) described
- General
- Spacing
- Misc.
- Capitalize event handlers there to support proper casing, off by default since its new
