# C28220
warning C28220: Integer expression expected for annotation '\<annotation\>'

 This warning indicates that an integer expression was expected as an annotation parameter, but an incompatible type was used instead.  This can be caused by attempting to use a sal annotation macro that does not fit the current scenario.

## Example

```cpp
#include <sal.h>

// Oops, the _In_reads_ annotation takes an integer type but is being passed a pointer
void f(_In_reads_(last) const int *buffer, const int *last)
{
  for(; buffer < last; ++buffer)
  {
    //...
  }
}
```
In this example the intent of the developer was to indicate that `buffer` would be read up to the `last` element.  The `_In_reads_` annotation does not fix the scenario because it is used to indicate a buffer size in number of elements.  The correct annotation in this case would be `_In_reads_to_ptr_` which indicates the end of the buffer with a pointer.

If there was no `_to_ptr_` equivalent to the annotation used, then the warning could have been addressed by converting the `last` pointer into a size value with `(buffer - size)` in the annotation.
```cpp
#include <sal.h>

void f(_In_reads_to_ptr_(last) const int *buffer, const int *last)
{
  for(; buffer < last; ++buffer)
  {
    //...
  }
}
```
