# CA5364: Do Not Disable HTTP Header Checking

|||
|-|-|
|TypeName|DoNotDisableHTTPHeaderChecking|
|CheckId|CA5365|
|Category|Microsoft.Security|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

Set HttpRuntimeSection.EnableHeaderChecking as false.

## Rule description

HTTP header checking enables encoding of the carriage return and newline characters, \r and \n, that are found in response headers. This encoding can help to avoid injection attacks that exploit an application that echoes untrusted data contained by the header.

## How to fix violations

Set HttpRuntimeSection.EnableHeaderChecking as true. Or remove the false assignment cause the default value is true.

## When to suppress warnings

HTTP header continuations rely on headers spanning multiple lines and require new lines in them. If you need to use header continuations, you need to set the EnableHeaderChecking property to false. Because there is a performance impact from looking at headers, if you are certain you are already doing the right checks, turning off this feature can improve the performance of your application. Before you disable this feature, be sure you are already taking the right precautions in this area.

## Pseudo-code examples

```csharp
using System;
using System.Web.Configuration;

class TestClass
{
    public void TestMethod()
    {
        HttpRuntimeSection httpRuntimeSection = new HttpRuntimeSection();
        httpRuntimeSection.EnableHeaderChecking = false;
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Web.Configuration;

class TestClass
{
    public void TestMethod()
    {
        HttpRuntimeSection httpRuntimeSection = new HttpRuntimeSection();
        httpRuntimeSection.EnableHeaderChecking = true;
    }
}
```
