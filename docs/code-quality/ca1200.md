# CA1200: Avoid using cref tags with a prefix

## Cause

The [cref](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/cref-attribute) tag in an XML documentation comment uses a [prefix](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file).

## Rule description

The [cref](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/cref-attribute) attribute in an XML documentation tag means "code reference." It specifies that the inner text of the tag is a code element, such as a type, method, or property. Use of cref tags with prefixes should be avoided, since it prevents the compiler from verifying references and the Visual Studio IDE from finding these symbol references and updating them during refactorings. It is recommended that you use the full syntax without prefixes to reference the symbol names in cref tags.

> [!NOTE]
> Rule CA1200 is not available in legacy analysis. It was first introduced in [FxCop analyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers).

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, modify the cref tag to not use prefixes. For example, the following two code snippets show a violation of the rule and how to fix it:

```csharp
// Violates CA1200
/// <summary>
/// Type <see cref="T:C" /> contains method <see cref="F:C.F" />
/// </summary>
class C
{
    public void F() { }
}
```

```csharp
// Does not violate CA1200
/// <summary>
/// Type <see cref="C" /> contains method <see cref="F" />
/// </summary>
class C
{
    public void F() { }
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress this warning at a single documentation site if the cref must use a prefix because the type being mentioned is not findable by the compiler. For example, if a cref is mentioning a special attribute in the full framework but you're in a file that compiles against the portable framework, you can suppress this warning.
