# C26402â€¯DONT_HEAP_ALLOCATE_MOVABLE_RESULT

Return a scoped object by value instead of a heap-allocated object if the type has a move constructor. See [C++ Core Guidelines R.3](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rr-ptr): *Warn if a function returns an object that was allocated within the function but has a move constructor. Suggest considering returning it by value instead.*.
