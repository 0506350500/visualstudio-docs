## Cause

The attribute `ValidateInput` is set to `false` for a class or method.

## Rule description

Request validation is a feature in ASP.NET that examines HTTP requests and determines whether they contain potentially dangerous content which may lead to injection attacks including cross-site-scripting.

## How to fix violations

Set the `ValidateInput` attribute to `true` or delete it entirely. 

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress this violation if all the payload in the incoming HTTP request is sourced from a trusted entity and could not be tampered with by an adversary prior to or during transport.

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

As of the time of this writing, the following pseudo-code sample illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.
The second parameter’s type is string.

```csharp
using System.Web.Mvc;

class TestControllerClass
{
    [ValidateInput(false)]
    public void TestActionMethod()
    {
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Web.Mvc;

class TestControllerClass
{
    [ValidateInput(true)]
    public void TestActionMethod()
    {
    }
}
```
