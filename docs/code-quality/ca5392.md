# CA5392: Use DefaultDllImportSearchPaths attribute for P/Invokes

|CheckId|CA5392|

|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

The <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DefaultDllImportSearchPathsAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> is not specified for P/Invokes while importing the 3rd DLL.

## Rule description

By default, P/Invokes using <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> probe a number of directories, including the current working directory for the library to load. This can be a security issue for certain applications, leading to DLL hijacking. 

For example, if a malicious DLL whose name is as same as the real one is somehow put under the current working directory, which will be searched firstly by default, then the malicious file will be loaded so that the attackers can do what ever they want to do. 

## How to fix violations

Use <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DefaultDllImportSearchPathsAttribute> to specify the DLL search path explicitly for the assembly or the method.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress this rule if:
- You're sure the loaded assembly is what you want.
- The imported assembly is a commonly used system assembly, like user32.dll, and the search path strategy follows the Known Dlls mechanism.

## Pseudo-code examples

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

class ExampleClass
{
    [DllImport("The3rdAssembly.dll")]
    public static extern int MessageBox(IntPtr hWnd, String text, String caption, uint type);

    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        MessageBox(new IntPtr(0), "Hello World!", "Hello Dialog", 0);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

class ExampleClass
{
    [DllImport("The3rdAssembly.dll")]
    [DefaultDllImportSearchPaths(DllImportSearchPath.UserDirectories)]
    public static extern int MessageBox(IntPtr hWnd, String text, String caption, uint type);

    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        MessageBox(new IntPtr(0), "Hello World!", "Hello Dialog", 0);
    }
}
```
