# IL3000: Avoid using accessing Assembly file path when publishing as a single-file

## Cause

When publishing as a single-file (e.g., by setting the PublishSingleFile property in a project to true) calling the `Assembly.Location` property when the
assembly is embedded inside the single-file bundle will always return an empty string.

## How to fix violations

If the app needs only needs the containing directory for the single-file bundle, consider using the `AppContext.BaseDirectory` property instead.

## When to suppress warnings

If the assembly being accessed is definitely not in the single-file bundle (e.g., because it is being loaded dynamically from a specific
file path) it is appropriate to silence this warning.
