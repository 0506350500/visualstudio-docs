# CA5367: Do Not Serialize Types With Pointer Fields

## Cause

Pointers are not "type safe" which means you cannot guarantee the correctness of the memory they point at. So, serializing types with pointer fields is dangerous, as it may allow an attacker to control the pointer.

## Rule description

This rule checks if there’s a serializable class with a pointer field or property. Members that can’t be serialized can be pointer, like static members or fields marked with <xref:System.NonSerializedAttribute?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## How to fix violations

Don't use pointer types for members in serializable class or not serialize the pointer members only.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not take the risk to use pointer in serializable types.

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;

[Serializable()]
unsafe class TestClassA
{
    private int* pointer;
} 
```

### Solution 1

```csharp
using System;

[Serializable()]
unsafe class TestClassA
{
    private int i;
} 
```

### Solution 2

```csharp
using System;

[Serializable()]
unsafe class TestClassA
{
    private static int* pointer;
} 
```
