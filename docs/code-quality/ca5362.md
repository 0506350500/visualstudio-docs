## Cause

A field or property may be referred by itself directly or indirectly.

## Rule description

A field or property may participate in a reference cycle. The serialization of such classes will lead to memory exhaustion so that valid users can't access the service or surrounding envrionment could get impacted.

## How to fix violations

Don't serialize that class, note the <xref:System.SerializableAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> must be removed. Or redesign your application so that the self-reffered members can be removed out of the serializable class.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress this rule.

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;

[Serializable()]
class ExampleClass
{
    private ExampleClass exampleClass;

    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;

class ExampleClass
{
    private ExampleClass exampleClass;

    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
    }
}
```
