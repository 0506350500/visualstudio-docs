# CA5386: Avoid hardcoding SecurityProtocolType value

|||
|-|-|
|TypeName|DoNotUseDeprecatedSecurityProtocols|
|CheckId|CA5386|
|Category|Microsoft.Security|
|Breaking Change|Non Breaking|

## Cause

- A safe but hardcoded <xref:System.Net.SecurityProtocolType?displayProperty=nameWithType> value was referenced.
- An integer value representing a safe protocol version was assigned to a <xref:System.Net.SecurityProtocolType> variable.

Safe values are:
- Tls12
- Tls13

## Rule description

Transport Layer Security (TLS) secures communication between computers, most commonly with Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). Protocol versions TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are deprecated, while TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are current. In the future, newer protocol versions of TLS may be deployed, and then TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 may be deprecated if security flaws are discovered. To ensure that your application remains secure, avoid hardcoding a protocol version and target at least .NET Framework v4.7.1. For more details, see [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with the .NET Framework](/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls).

## How to fix violations

Don't use hardcode TLS protocol versions.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress this warning if you need to connect to a legacy service, which can't be upgraded to use secure TLS configurations.

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        // CA5386 violation
        ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12;
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Net

Public Class TestClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        ' CA5386 violation
        ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12
    End Sub
End Class
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;

public class TestClass
{
    public void TestMethod()
    {
        // Let the operating system decide what TLS protocol version to use.
        // See https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Net

Public Class TestClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        ' Let the operating system decide what TLS protocol version to use.
        ' See https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls
    End Sub
End Class
```
