# Visualize dotnet counters from the Visual Studio profiler


The .NET Counters tool allows you to visualize [dotnet counters](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-counters) over time right from within the Visual Studio profiler.


> [!NOTE]
> The .NET Counters tool requires Visual Studio 2019 version 16.7 or later and targets .NET Core 3.0+.

## Setup

1. Open the Performance Profiler (**Alt + F2** or **Debug -> Performance Profiler**)Â in Visual Studio.

2. Select the **.NET Counters** check box.

   ![.NET Counter tool selected](../profiling/media/dotnet-counters-tool-selected.png ".NET Counters tool selected")

3. Click the **Start** button to run the tool.

For more information on how to optimize tool performance, see [Optimizing Profiler settings](../profiling/optimize-profiler-settings.md).


## Understand Your data

While the tool is initially collecting data, you can see the live values of [dotnet counters](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-counters).


![.NET Counter tool collecting](../profiling/media/dotnet-counters-tool-collecting.png ".NET Counters tool collecting")

You can also view graphs of the counters by selecting the checkbox next to the counters names. You can display the graphs of multiple counters at a time.

Once you are done exercising your app and collecting data, you can stop collection for an even more detailed report. To do this hit the Stop Collection button.

Once the report loads you should see a finalized report similar to the one shown below.

![.NET Counter tool report](../profiling/media/dotnet-counters-tool-report.png ".NET Counters tool report")

The report shows you the following values:

- Min - The minimum value for that counter in the selected time range.
- Max - The maximum value for that counter in the selected time range.
- Average - The average value for that counter in the selected time range.

You can filter or add columns in the table by right clicking on the column headings and selecting a heading.

![.NET Counter tool columns](../profiling/media/dotnet-counters-tool-columns.png ".NET Counters tool columns")

You can also view graphs in the detailed report by selecting the checkboxes next to counters. The data in the tables represents the values of the entire duration of your collected trace by defualt. To filter down the data to a specific time range, click and drag on the graphs.

![.NET Counter tool time filtering](../profiling/media/dotnet-counters-tool-timefiltering.png ".NET Counters tool time filtering")

The table will now update to relevant value for the time selected in the graphs. Use the Clear Selection button to reset the selected time range to the entire trace.
