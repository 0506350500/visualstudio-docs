# Getting Started with devinit

## Step 1: Get devinit

devinit is currently only available as part of GitHub Codespaces for Visual Studio and is accessible from the integrated terminal in Visual Studio. In the future, devinit will be available as part of Visual Studio.

## Step 2: Define your environment

The most important step is to define your 'developer' environment in a [_.devinit.json_ file](devinit-json.md). This file will be used by devinit to create your environment when you run `devinit init`.

For this step, think about the instructions you'd give someone to get up and running in the repo. For example, do they need to have SQL installed? A specific version of .NET Core? etc. Then for each of those dependencies look for a corresponding devinit tool over in the [list of tools](devinit-tool-list.md)) and add that to your repos _.devinit.json_ file.

## Step 3: Profit! ðŸ’°

Now all someone has to do after cloning your repo is run `devinit init`.

```batch
> devinit init
```

If you're using [GitHub Codespaces for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/) you can configure `devinit init` to run automatically when the Codespace is provisioned, to do that have a look at the [devinit and Codespaces documentation](devinit-and-codespaces.md).
