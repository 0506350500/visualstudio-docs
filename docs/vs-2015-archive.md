# Visual Studio 2015 documentation

As of October 13, 2020, the Visual Studio 2015 documentation has been moved to the [previous-versions archive](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2015). This date marks the end of Mainstream Support for this product. On that date,Visual Studio 2015 entered Extended Support. See [Fixed Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/fixed) and [](/visualstudio/releases/2019/servicing#support-for-older-versions-of-visual-studio).

What this means is that Visual Studio 2015 articles no longer appear in the version selector on this site, and are no longer indexed in search engines. To search in the archived content, or find a specific article for Visual Studio 2015:

1. Navigate to the Visual Studio 2015 content on the Previous Versions site (as linked in the first paragraph).

1. Use the site search box to search in the Visual Studio 2015 content, or to search titles only, use the title filter.

We recommend upgrading to the latest version, Visual Studio 2019. To download, see [Visual Studio downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
