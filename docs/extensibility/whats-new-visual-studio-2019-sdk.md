# What's New in the Visual Studio 2019 SDK

The Visual Studio SDK has the following new and updated features for Visual Studio 2019.

## Synchronously autoloaded extensions warning

Users will now see a warning if any of their installed extensions are synchronously autoloaded on startup. You can learn more about the warning at [Synchronously autoloaded extensions](synchronously-autoloaded-extensions.md).

## Single, unified Visual Studio SDK

You can now get all Visual Studio SDK assets through a single NuGet package [Microsoft.VisualStudio.SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/microsoft.visualstudio.sdk).
