# Work with GitHub accounts in Visual Studio

If you have a public GitHub or GitHub enterprise account, you can use it to sign in to Visual Studio. After you add your account, you'll be able to take advantage of the platform integration by accessing and creating GitHub repositories, right from Visual Studio.  

## Adding public GitHub accounts

You can add your public GitHub account if you're already signed in to Visual Studio with a Microsoft account, or a work or school account.

Click on the icon with your initials in the upper-right corner of the Visual Studio environment. Then, go to **Account settings...** to manage your accounts.

Under the **All Accounts** submenu, click on the plus sign to add an account, and select **GitHub**.

You'll be redirected to the browser, where you can sign in with your GitHub credentials. After you sign in, you'll get a success window in the browser, and you can return to Visual Studio.

You'll have both accounts present in your **All Accounts** submenu.

If you're not already signed in to Visual Studio with a different account, look for the **Sign in** link in the upper-right corner of the Visual Studio environment. Then, follow the instructions above to add your GitHub account.
