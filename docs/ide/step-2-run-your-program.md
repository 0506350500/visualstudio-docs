# Step 2: Run your PictureViewer app

When you create a Windows Forms Application project, you actually build a program that runs. In this tutorial, your *PictureViewer* app doesn't do much yet&mdash;although it will. For now though, it just displays an empty window that shows **Form1** in the title bar.

Here's how to run your program. 

1. Choose one of the following methods:

    - Choose the **F5** key.

    - On the menu bar, choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging**.

    - On the toolbar, choose the **Start Debugging** button, which appears as follows:

      ![Start Debugging toolbar button](../ide/media/express_icondebug.png)<br>
      ***Start Debugging*** *toolbar button*

1. Visual Studio runs your program, and a window called **Form1** appears. The following screenshot shows the program you just built. The program is running, and you'll soon add to it.

***Windows Forms*** *application program, running*

1. Go back to the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE), and then look at the new toolbar. Additional buttons appear on the toolbar when you run a program. These buttons let you do things like stop and start your program, and help you track down any errors (bugs) it may have. For this example, we're using it to start and stop the program.

     ![Debugging toolbar](../ide/media/express_debugtoolbar.png)<br>
***Debugging*** *toolbar*

1. Use one of the following methods to stop your program:

    - On the toolbar, choose the **Stop Debugging** button.

    - On the menu bar, choose **Debug** > **Stop Debugging**.

    - Use your keyboard and press **Shift**+**F5**.

    - Choose the **X** button in the upper corner of the **Form1** window.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you run your program from inside the IDE, it's called debugging because you typically do so to locate and fix bugs (errors) in the program. Although this program is small and doesn't really do anything yet, it's still a real program. You follow the same procedure to run and debug other programs. To learn more about debugging, see [First look at the debugger](../debugger/debugger-feature-tour.md).
