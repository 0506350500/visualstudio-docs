# JavaScript Language Reference

JavaScript is a scripting language that can be embedded in web pages and other applications.  
  
The Microsoft implementation of JavaScript is compliant with the ECMAScript Language Specification 5th Edition. It also provides additional features that are not included in the ECMA Standards.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft has joined the community-wide effort to make [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) the web’s one-stop, premiere development reference, starting by redirecting all 500+ pages of Microsoft’s JavaScript API reference from [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com) to their MDN counterparts and porting our legacy JS extensions reference for historical and servicing purposes.
