# About your subscription benefits
As a Visual Studio subscriber, you have access to a variety of benefits depending on your subscription level.  There are several important things to note about benefits.

## Benefits vary based on your subscription. 
The benefits included in your subscription vary based on the type of subscription you purchased.  To see which benefits are included in various subscriptions, please visit our [Visual Studio Subscription benefits page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/).  You can filter the view by subscription level and by benefit category to get to the specific information you need. 

You can also use the articles on this site to determine whether a specific benefit is included in your subscription. 

## Use categories to help find benefits
To make it easy to find the benefits that most interest you, we've grouped them into three categories: 
- Tools
- Professional Development
- Support

By default, all of your benefits are displayed when you visit <https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits>.  However, you can filter the list by selecting any of the three categories.

## Benefits are subject to change
The Visual Studio subscriptions team strives to provide benefits within subscriptions that are useful, timely, and relevant.  Tools, services, products and other benefits provided in subscriptions are subject to change without notice. 

## Benefits and offers provided by partners
Some of the benefits included with Visual Studio subscriptions, including some of the most popular benefits like training and tools, are provided by our partners.  The details of those offers are determined by the partners.  Any support available for those benefits or offers is also provided by the partners.  Examples of benefits provided by our partners include training from Pluralsight and DataCamp, and tools from CAST Highlight, CloudPilot, and WhiteSource among others.
