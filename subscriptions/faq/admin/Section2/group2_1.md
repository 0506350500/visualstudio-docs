## How do my end users activate their subscription?

The subscription is active and can be used as soon as it has been assigned from within the Visual Studio Administrator portal. Your subscriber can sign into the [Visual Studio Subscribers portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/) or VS IDE right away, and will receive a welcome email letting them know the subscription has been assigned.
