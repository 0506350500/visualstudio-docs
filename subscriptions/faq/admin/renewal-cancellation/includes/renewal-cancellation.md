## How do I cancel monthly and annual subscriptions?
When you cancel a Visual Studio cloud subscription, you are canceling automatic renewal. The subscription continues until its normal renewal date and then simply expires. At expiration, the Visual Studio subscriber can no longer use Visual Studio or any other benefits from the subscription.

### How to cancel monthly and annual subscriptions 
You need to log in as the account admin and set the number of subscriptions for your agreement to zero (0). Follow these steps to reduce the number of subscriptions:
1.	Sign in to https://manage.visualstudio.com
2.	If you are an admin on more than one agreement, choose the desired agreement from the drop-down list.
3.	Select the Overview icon at the top left to display information about your subscriptions.
4.	Locate the entry for the subscriptions you wish to cancel, and select Change quantity. This will take you the Visual Studio Marketplace where you will be able to update your purchase quantity. 
5.	Set the quantity to zero (0). Your subscriptions will remain in place until their scheduled billing date, but will not renew when the billing date is reached.


### How long does it take for cancellations to take effect?
With monthly cloud subscriptions, cancellations take effect the first day of the next month. If you only cancel some of your monthly cloud subscriptions, be sure to remove users on the first of the next month to ensure that the correct people continue to have active subscriptions assigned.

For annual cloud subscriptions, cancellations take effect the first day of the month following 12 months from the original purchase, or 12 months from the last annual renewal charge. For instance, if you bought a Visual Studio Professional annual cloud subscription on January 3, 2018 then it remains active until February 1, 2019 when it automatically renews for another year. If you cancel at any time between then and February 1, 2020 then the subscription will expire on February 1, 2020. There is no rebate for canceling part way through the subscription year with annual cloud subscriptions.
