## What does it mean when my subscribers add alternate identities?

Adding an alternate account allows your developers to access some of their Visual Studio subscription benefits (VS IDE, Azure DevOps and Azure) with a different identity than that which the subscription is assigned to. This doesn't provide a copy of subscription to the other account; it only provides the ability to access the two benefits with the alternate account. [Read more about Visual Studio Subscription identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-alternate-identity).
