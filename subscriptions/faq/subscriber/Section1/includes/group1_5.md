## I have a new agreement.  How do I move my subscribers?

You can export your subscribers from your previous agreement and add them to your new agreement using the Bulk add button.

Note: your subscribers will receive an email when the new subscription is assigned to them. Learn more about [exporting subscribers](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/exporting-subscriptions) and using the [Bulk add](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/assign-license#bulk-assignments) feature. If you have more than 200 subscribers on your previous agreement our [support team can assist you](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/support/#talktous). Select \'Account, Subscription, and Billing Support\' and select your country. Depending on your location, support may be available via email, chat, or phone.
