Learn more about [exporting subscribers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/subscriptions/exporting-subscriptions) and using the [Bulk add](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/subscriptions/assign-license#bulk-assignments) feature. If you have more than 200 subscribers on your previous agreement our [support team can assist you](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/support/#talktous).
