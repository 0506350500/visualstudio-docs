## What is the difference between a Sign-in email address and a Notification email address?

Individuals who are assigned a subscription will receive periodic communications from the Visual Studio team, including an email letting them know they have been assigned a subscription. If these emails should be sent to a separate email address than that which they should sign into theâ€¯ [Visual Studio Subscriptions Portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/) or VS IDE you can add a notification email address when adding a subscriber, or when editing an existing subscriber.
