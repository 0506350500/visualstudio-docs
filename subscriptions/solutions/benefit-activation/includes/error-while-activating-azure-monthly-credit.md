## I'm getting an error while trying to activate my Azure monthly credit.

You can only have one Azure subscription associated with the Visual Studio Subscriptions monthly Azure dev/test individual credit. If you’ve previously activated the monthly Azure credit associated with your Visual Studio subscription, you will need use that Azure subscription or delete it to spin up a new one associated with the credit. You can transfer your resources to save your work. 

### Azure subscription log in and tenant 

When you activate your Visual Studio subscription, we link the identity (or login) that you used during activation with the Visual Studio subscription. This way, we can recognize you on the Visual Studio Subscriptions portal, in Azure DevOps, and in Azure. 

You can also associate an [alternate account](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-alternate-identity) with your Visual Studio subscription. Adding an alternate account to your Visual Studio subscription allows you to access the subscription benefits, like Azure DevOps and Azure, with a different identity than that which the subscription is assigned to.  

Sign into the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with the ID you set the account up with.  

### Azure directories 

You can have multiple directories as part of your Azure subscription. Make sure you are using the directory you set up the Azure subscription. You can view and switch directories by clicking on the account icon in the top right corner in the Azure portal. 

### Change Azure subscription email 
You can only have one Azure subscription associated with the Visual Studio Subscriptions monthly Azure dev/test individual credit. If you’ve previously activated the monthly Azure credit associated with your Visual Studio subscription, you have to use that Azure subscription or delete it to spin up a new one associated with the credit.
