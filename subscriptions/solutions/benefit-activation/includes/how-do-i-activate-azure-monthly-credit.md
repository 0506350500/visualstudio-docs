## How do I activate my monthly Azure dev/test individual credit? 
1. Sign in to the [subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) and locate the Azure tile in the Tools section on the Benefits page.  Click Activate link at the bottom of the benefit tile. If you can’t locate the Azure monthly credit tile, please use the [benefits comparison page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/#azure?cat=visual-studio-enterprise-subscription) to verify that your subscription includes a monthly credit. 
1. If you don't have an existing Azure subscription, you'll be asked to fill in the required information to create your Azure subscription. The first step is to provide your personal information and then click Next. 
1. You’ll verify your identity using a simple verification code. Provide your phone number and choose whether you'd like to receive the code by text or phone. Enter the code you receive and click Verify code. 
1. For the final step, click the checkbox to accept the terms, then click Sign up.
