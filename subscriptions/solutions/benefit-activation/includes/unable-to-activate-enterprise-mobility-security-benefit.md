## I'm unable to activate my Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) benefit.

Enterprise Mobility + Security for compliance and information protection is included in the Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription. Starting in September 2019, all **new** members of the Office 365 Developer Program (including Visual Studio Professional and Enterprise subscribers) can sign up for a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription (Windows not included). This replaces the Office 365 E3 developer subscription that was made available starting in March 2018. 

### How to activate 
1. Sign in to the [subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). Locate the Microsoft 365 benefit tile in the "Tools" category and click on Activate.
1. On the welcome screen, choose your region/country, enter your company name, and click the checkbox to accept the terms of use. Then click Next. 
1. On the Program Preferences screen, fill out the various fields to indicate your preferences and areas of interest. When you're finished, click Activate subscription. 
1. In the Set up your developer subscription dialog, choose your region/country, create your username and domain, and set your password. Then click Continue. 
1. Specify your country code a phone number that supports SMS messages, and click Send Code. You'll receive a code via an SMS message. 
1. Enter the code you received in the text message and click 
1. You'll see the Office Dev Center page, with your subscription information displayed. It's a good idea to take this opportunity to assign subscriptions to your users. Click Go to subscription. 
1. Sign in to your account. 
1. Cancel the introduction dialog box. 
1. Click Got it to close the Office 365 apps dialog
1. Select Users in the left nav pane, then choose Active users. 
1. A list of your active users will appear. If you're just setting up your subscription, you will be the only one listed. Click Add a user. 
1. You may be asked to personalize your sign-in and email. Choose the options that work best for you, and click Next. 
1. On the Add new users page, you'll see a grid you can use to add users who will all have licenses assigned to them. If you need to add more users click + Add another user. 

After you add users, you'll have the option to do things like create teams and install applications. You can either do any or all of those things now, or come back to the admin center any time to set those up.
