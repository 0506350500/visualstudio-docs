## Enterprise Mobility + Security for compliance and information protection is included in the Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription. Starting in September 2019, all new members of the Office 365 Developer Program (including Visual Studio Professional and Enterprise subscribers) can sign up for a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription (Windows not included). This replaces the Office 365 E3 developer subscription that was made available starting in March 2018.
