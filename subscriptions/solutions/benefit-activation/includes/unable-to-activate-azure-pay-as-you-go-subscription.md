## I'm unable to activate my Azure Dev / Test Pay-As-You-Go subscription.

As a Visual Studio subscriber, you receive exclusive discounted hourly rates for dev/test and cloud use rights for your subscription software on Microsoft Azure. 

### Set up a Subscription

1. Sign in to the [subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) and locate the Azure Pay-As-You-Go tile in the Tools section. Click the Activate link at the bottom of the benefit tile.
1. If you have already activated an Azure account as part of your subscription benefits (for example, if you have an Enterprise subscription and activated your $150 monthly Azure DevTest individual credit), skip to step 5. 
1. On the Microsoft Azure Sign up page, you’ll have the option to either set up the Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test offer (PAYG), or upgrade to the Visual Studio Enterprise offer. Click Continue with the current offer (Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test) if you don’t wish to upgrade.
1. To verify your identity, enter a phone number, and choose “Send text message” or “Call me”. Enter the code you receive. Click Verify code. 
1. Next, please provide the billing information for your account and click Next. (This will be the credit card that is charged for all your Azure purchases.) 
1. In the Agreement section, click on the check box to accept the subscription agreement, offer details and privacy statement, then click Purchase. 
1. On the Welcome to Microsoft Azure page you’ll have the option to buy a support plan, or get started using your subscription. 
1. If you choose to get started using your subscription, you’ll see the [Microsoft Azure portal[(https://portal.azure.com/) and, if it’s your first visit, you’ll be offered a quick tour of some of the features. Once you’ve completed or opted out of the tour, you’ll see the Dashboard.
