## As a Visual Studio subscriber, you can use a range of features in Azure DevOps that are included with your subscription as a benefit. You'll be able to use these same features in each Azure DevOps organization in which you are a member, whether you created the organization or were added by someone else. 
1. Sign in to the [subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) and locate the Azure DevOps tile in the Tools section.
2. Click the Get started link at the bottom of the benefit tile.
3. Remaining steps to be added here.
