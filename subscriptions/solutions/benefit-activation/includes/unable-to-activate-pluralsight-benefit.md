## I'm unable to activate my Pluralsight benefit.

Depending on which Visual Studio subscription or program membership you have, you may be eligible for up to six months of free, unlimited access to the entire Pluralsight catalog.  

### How to activate 
1. Sign in to the [subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). Locate the Pluralsight benefit tile in the Professional Development section and click on the Activate button. This will take you directly to the activation page on the Pluralsight website. 
1. Create your account with Pluralsight by filling out the information form and click Redeem. You have 10 minutes to finish this step, otherwise you will need to start over with step 1.
