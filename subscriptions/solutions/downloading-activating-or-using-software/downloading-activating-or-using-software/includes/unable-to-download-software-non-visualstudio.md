## I'm unable to download or activate software (excluding Visual Studio family)

The software downloads available to you depends on the subscription you're using. You can find downloads and product keys a few ways. 

### Excel list of available software 
You can download an Excel spreadsheet containing an extensive list of [available software titles](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/5/4/15454442-CF17-47B9-A65D-DF84EF88511B/Visual_Studio_by_Subscription_Level.xlsx) for all subscription types. To use this, you will need to know what subscriptions you have.  

To check what subscriptions are available to you, log into the [Visual Studio Subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions).
* If you have more than one subscription associated with the same sign-in address, you will see the downloads included with the highest-level subscription, regardless of which subscription you're viewing.  

### Find software downloads 
1. Sign into the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits).  
1. Go to the [featured downloads page](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads/featured).  
1. Here you will be able to see a list of popular downloads or search a specific product.  

### Product keys page 
All keys are also available in aggregate on the [Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys) page. When multiple keys exist for a single product, notes will be displayed on the Notes column for the download to assist you in identifying which key should be used.
