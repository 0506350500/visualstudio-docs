# The MODERNRequirements4TFS benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions

MODERNRequirements SmartOffice4TFS extends the capabilities of TFS or Azure DevOps Services with Microsoft Word-based reporting, and quick, simplified rich text authoring.  ModernRequirements4TFS provides work item baselining and HTML5 simulation capabilities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective May 30, 2019 the ModernRequirements benefit was removed from the Visual Studio Subscriptions portal and is no longer available.  Subscribers who have previously activated the benefit will continue to have access to ModernRequirement for the duration of the ModernRequirements six-month subscription.
