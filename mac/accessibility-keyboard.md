# Keyboard navigation in Visual Studio for Mac

Visual Studio for Mac is accessible by keyboard users using most common macOS keyboard shortcuts as well as many specific to Visual Studio for Mac. We will cover some basic keyboard commands for both, and demonstrate how to set up Visual Studio for Mac keyboard shortcuts.

## How to: Use Keyboard Navigation

Keyboard navigation support is built right into macOS, but in order to have the most comprehensive experience you should set macOS to navigate **All controls**:

Setting **Full Keyboard Access** to **All controls** allows you to navigate through all controls in a window or dialog.

## Customizing keyboard shortcuts

Visual Studio for Mac has a range of keyboard shortcuts for various tasks. You can view and edit these as follows:

1. Open the Visual Studio for Mac preferences using **Visual Studio (menu) > Preferences (&#8984;,)**

1. Navigate to **Environment > Key Bindings**

1. Scroll through the list or search for the shortcut or command

1. Select the command

1. Select **Key Binding** and type a key combination

1. Select **Apply**

> [!TIP] You can chose from a list of key binding schemes to best suit your needs if you are familiar with other common keyboard shortcuts, for example Visual Studio in Windows.
